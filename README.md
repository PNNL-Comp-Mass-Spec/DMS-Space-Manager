# DMS Space Manager

The DMS Space Manager is a part of PRISM, the Proteomics Research Information and Management System.
The space manager monitors the free space on Proto-x storage servers,
purging old dataset files to free up space if the available space drops below a threshold.

Files are validated to be present in MyEMSL prior to deletion.
